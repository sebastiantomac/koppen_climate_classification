MAT = mean annual air temperature (°C); 
Tcold = the air temperature of the coldest month (°C); 
Thot = the air temperature of the warmest month (°C); 
Tmon10 = the number of months with air temperature >=10 °C (unitless);
MAP = mean annual precipitation (mm y-1);
Pdry = precipitation in the driest month (mm month-1);
Psdry = precipitation in the driest month in summer (mm month-1); 
Pwdry = precipitation in the driest month in winter (mm month-1);
Pswet = precipitation in the wettest month in summer (mm month-1);
Pwwet = precipitation in the wettest month in winter (mm month-1);
Pthreshold=2×MAT+28 if >70% of precipitation falls in summer, otherwise Pthreshold=2×MAT+14. Summer (winter) is the six-month period that is warmer (colder) between April-September and October-March.
